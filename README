EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes
the <number> out of <number>w or <number>f{char} by highlighting all possible
choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.

When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding or
following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.

Example:

    <cursor>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

If the word motion w is triggered with the default mapping <Leader>w, the
text is updated (no braces are actually added, the letters are highlighted in
red by default):

    <cursor>Lorem {a}psum {b}olor {c}it {d}met.

Press 'c' to jump to the beginning of the word "sit":

    Lorem ipsum dolor <cursor>sit amet.

And that's it!

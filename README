EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the <number> out of <number>w or <number>f{char} by highlighting all possible choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.

When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding or following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.

* Video tutorial on Nettuts+: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/vim-essential-plugin-easymotion/

Usage example:

Type <Leader>w to trigger the word motion "w". When the motion is triggered, the text is updated (no braces are actually added, the text is highlighted in red by default):

    <cursor>Lorem {a}psum {b}olor {c}it {d}met.

Press "c" to jump to the beginning of the word "sit":

    Lorem ipsum dolor <cursor>sit amet.
